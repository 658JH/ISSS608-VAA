    "text": "Write-up\n\nThe two age-sex pyramid charts reveal different levels of detail in different situations; the first chart with percentages can hide the actual size but reveal the proportion among different data categories. In contrast, the second chart can provide both the size and proportion of each category (e.g., Age Group (AG)) from a different group of data (e.g., Planning Area (PA)).\nBased on the Age-sex pyramid chart, provides better visualization for the population of different age groups in each planning area; the bar length represents the size of the age group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall chart of Males or Females represents the distribution of different age groups within the planning area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Age Group of Males of Ang Mo Kio trends, it can be figured out that the birth rate in recent five years is lower than in the previous five years.\nCompare the Age Group between Males and Females in Ang Mo Kio on the Age-sex pyramid chart; it depicts the birth rate of Males more than females within Ang Mo Kio.\nThe chart of Punggol below depicts that most people in the Punggol area are aged between 30 and 55.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the chart between Punggol and Bedok, it is easily found that Bedok has more elderly citizens than the Punggol area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy comparing the chart horizontally among different planning areas, the chart can reveal lots of information from the chart itself without a single word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of the birth rate of Sengkang, Tampines, and Woodlands is much large than Toa Payoh, Clementi, and Ang Mo Kio by comparing the bar length based on age group 0_to_4.\nOverall population size of different planning areas can be revealed by the size of the combined area of both Blue and Pink of each planning area from the Chart, e.g., The overall population size of Seng Kang, Bedok, Tampines, and Woodlands are much larger than Toa Payoh, Clementi, and Sembawang.\n\n\nBy supplying different information to the Age-sex pyramid chart, it will provide a different level of detail; the Age-sex pyramid below are coloured with Type of Dwelling (TOD) or Subzone respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChart coloured with Type of Dwelling (TOD) reveals information such as Planning Areas like Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Tampines, and Toa Payoh having more 3-room flats than Punggol, Sembawang, Seng Kang, and Woodlands.\nIt also reveals that most people in Singapore stay in 4 or 5-Room flats than 3-Room flats in Punggol and Sembawang, Seng Kang, Tampines, and Woodlands.\nChart coloured with Sub Zone reveals information such as the no. of popular zone areas in each Planning Area, e.g., four main areas in Tampines - Simei, Tampines East, Tampines West, and Tampines North.\n\n\nAge-sex pyramid chart can reveal plenty of information to the target audience for decision-making; it also can reveal information based on the different requirements to hide unnecessary information from the chart."

    "text": "1. Overview\nIn this Take-home exercise 2, I’ve chosen one of my classmate take-home exercise 1 submission and analyzed the charts regarding clarity and aesthetics. The original design will be remade using the data visualization principles and best practices learned from lessons 1 and 2.\nThe dataset used in take-home exercises 1 and 2 is from Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022 from the Department of Statistics, Singapore, and processed by RStudio with tidyverse family of packages and visualized by ggplot2 and related packages.\n\n\n2. Data Preparation\n\n2.1 Loading packages\n\n# import necessary packages\npacman::p_load(scales, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n2.2 Import data\n\ndsl <- \"Data Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022\"\n\n# read data from csv file\ndata <- read_csv(\"./data/respopagesextod2022.csv\", \n              col_types = list(\n                              PA   = col_character(),\n                              SZ   = col_character(),\n                              AG   = col_character(),\n                              Sex  = col_character(),\n                              TOD  = col_character(),\n                              Pop  = col_integer(),\n                              Time = col_integer()\n                            )\n              )\n\n# ensure all data are year 2022\npop_data <- data %>%\n  filter(Time == 2022) %>%\n    filter(PA %in% c(\"Ang Mo Kio\",\n                        \"Bedok\",\n                        \"Choa Chu Kang\",\n                        \"Hougang\",\n                        \"Jurong West\",\n                        \"Sengkang\",\n                        \"Tampines\",\n                        \"Woodlands\",\n                        \"Yishun\")\n           ) %>%\n  # rearrange the order for age group\n  mutate(AG = fct_relevel(AG, \"0_to_4\",\"5_to_9\")) %>%\n  # rearrange the order for male and female\n  mutate(Sex = fct_relevel(Sex, \"Males\",\"Females\"))\n\n\n\n2.3 Data Attributes\n\n\n\nNo.\nAttribute Name\nDescription of Attribute\n\n\n\n\n1\nPA\nPlanning Area\n\n\n2\nSZ\nSubzone\n\n\n3\nAG\nAge Group\n\n\n4\nSex\nMale or Female\n\n\n5\nTOD\nType of Dwelling\n\n\n6\nPop\nSize of Population\n\n\n7\nTime\nYear of the data collected\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Critique\n\n3.1 Original Design\nThe original design shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Zoom-in\nThe chart shows that planning area having same proportion of prime woring age on Female between Yishun and Jurong West.\n\n\n\nPopulation size of Yishun\nPopulation size of Jurong West\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart also shows that planning area having same proportion of prime woring age on Female between Ang Mo Kio and Bedok.\n\n\n\nPopulation size of Ang Mo Kio\nPopulation size of Bedok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Clarity\n\n3.3.1 Grouping on Age Groups\nThe original design shown in 3.1 has grouped 19 age groups into six main groups, but it does not provide charities on the new six groups introduced; but introduces extra confusion to the chart.\nFor instance, group 10_to_14 has been grouped into Early Working Age, while the legal working age in Singapore starts from 14 but with limitations. MOM.\nThe age group 80_to_84 has been grouped into oldest-old on the chart, Publications such as Suzman R, Riley MW. Introducing the “oldest old”. Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc. 1985 Spring;63(2):177-86. PMID: 3846808. shows that oldest-old refers to those aged 85 and above. It is important to have the references on the chart published for new terms introduced, to avoid any misunderstanding from public.\nThe bar of Age-sex pyramid chart are design to provide trends for the variable when more data or bins are shown on the chart, hence, it is not necessary to further group the bins to redunce the size of bins, unless the chart unable to display all the bins on a single chart.\n\n\n3.3.2 Data Revelation\nThe original design showed population size in percentile for all the planning areas. The percentile of male and female in each planning area is calculated based on the population size of the planning area, not on common population size (such as using the total population size of Singapore).\nThe chart shows that the proportion of famale in prime woring age is same between Yishun and Jurong West, and the same between Ang Mo Kio and Bedok. However, the data below shows that the population size of female from age 25 to 54 has large differences between Ang Mo Kio and Bedok.\nHence, the original chart does not reveal the actual size or the correct proportion of each age group size versus the entire population.\n\npop_sum <- pop_data %>%\n  filter(PA == \"Ang Mo Kio\"| \n         PA == \"Bedok\" | \n         PA == \"Jurong West\" | \n         PA == \"Yishun\" ) %>%\n  filter(Sex == \"Males\") %>%\n  filter(AG %in% c(\"25_to_29\", \n                   \"30_to_34\", \n                   \"35_to_39\", \n                   \"40_to_44\", \n                   \"45_to_49\",\n                   \"50_to_54\")) %>%\n  group_by(PA) %>%\n  summarise(total = sum(Pop), .groups=\"keep\")\n  \n\npop_sum %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = total, x = PA)) + \n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", \n           fill=\"lightblue\", \n           show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(PA, total, \n                label = scales::comma(total), \n                fill = NULL), \n            data = pop_sum) +\n  labs(x = \"Planning Area\", \n       y = \"Population Size\", \n       title = \"Female Population Size of four planning areas from age 25 to 54 of Year 2022\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Age-sex pyramid chart\nThe majority of age-sex pyramid provides color differences for male and female, the original chart having only color differences for age groups but not gender. The meaning of the bar on the discovered after when referring to the labels on the bottom of the chart.\n\n\n3.4 Aesthetics\n\n3.4.1 Legend - Coloring\nThe chart does not show a legend for the color applied to different age classifications; it would be better to have a legend for colors applied.\n\n\n3.4.2 X-Axis reference line\nThe chart figure on each bar provides extra difficulty when comparing the length of the bar among different groups visually.\n\n\n3.4.3 Agx-Sex order\nThe chart should generally display the male population on the left and the female population on the right side to align with the general practice of adopting the age-sex pyramid chart.\n\n\n\n\n4. Design Proposed\nA proposed design of the Age-sex pyramid chart is shown as follows, The chart shown the exact same results to public regardless of using proportion of population size or actual population size. It provides a constant visual results to the public on using both proportion or actual size of population.\nIt provide color difference and reference line for male and female in each planning area for better comparsion, and reference line are provided in each planning area when compare the male and famle population size among each age group or planning area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Final Design\n\n5.1 Data Preparation\nFirst, calculate the population size and population proportion between male and female at age group level for each planning area.\n\n# calculate total population size\nPop_Prop <- pop_data %>%\n    summarise(Pop_Prop = sum(Pop))\n\n# calculate population size and proportion for \n# Male and Female of each age group for each planning area\npop_summary <- pop_data %>%\n  group_by(PA, AG, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Pop_Size = sum(Pop), \n            Pop_Size / Pop_Prop * 100, \n            .groups=\"rowwise\")\n\n\n\n5.2 Visualize Population Size\nNext, Display the Age-sex pyramid chart based on population size of each planning area for top 9 planning areas in Singapore.\n\n# label position adjustment based on gender\nlabel_position_nudge <- function(df){\n  ifelse(df$Sex == \"Males\", (sd(df$Pop_Size)/3)*-1, sd(df$Pop_Size)/3)\n}\n\n# tick position adjustment based on gender\ntick_position_nudge <- function(br) {\n  ifelse(abs(br) >= 1000, paste0(abs(br)/1000, \"k\"), abs(br))\n}\n\n# age-sex pyramid chart\npop_summary %>%\n  # transform the data to show male on the left\n  mutate(\n    Pop_Size  = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", Pop_Size * (-1), Pop_Size * 1),\n    Pop_Label = paste0(scales::comma(abs(round(Pop_Size))))\n  ) %>%\n  # plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = Pop_Size, y = AG, label = Pop_Label)) + \n  # fill the value for the plot\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Sex), inherit.aes = TRUE) +\n  # display label for the bar\n  geom_text(aes(label = Pop_Label), \n            position = position_nudge(x = label_position_nudge(pop_summary)), \n            size = 5, \n            color=\"darkgrey\") + \n  # change color of male and female\n  scale_fill_manual(\"\", values = c(\"#EF756A\", \"#3FBFC5\")) + \n  # add x-ticks\n  scale_x_continuous(\"\", \n                     breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n=10),\n                     labels = function(br) tick_position_nudge(br)\n                     )+\n  # add tick labels\n  labs(title = \"Singapore Population of Top 9 Planning Areas\",\n       subtitle = \"Population Pyramid by Gender & Age Groups, June 2022\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Age Groups\",\n       caption = dsl\n       ) + \n  # group by planning areas\n  facet_wrap(~ PA, ncol = 3) +\n  # apply theme\n  theme_bw() + \n  # adjust legend\n  theme(\n        text = element_text(size = 16),\n        legend.position = 'top', \n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Visualize Population Proportion\nAlternatively, The Age-sex pyramid chart can show the same results based on the proportion of population size, so that the actual population size of each planning area can be hidden from the chart to public if there is a such requirement.\n\n# label position adjustment based on gender\nlabel_position_nudge <- function(df){\n  ifelse(df$Sex == \"Males\", (sd(df$Pop_Prop)/3)*-1, sd(df$Pop_Prop)/3)\n}\n\n# age-sex pyramid chart\npop_summary %>%\n  # transform the data to show male on the left\n  mutate(\n    Pop_Prop  = ifelse(Sex == \"Males\", Pop_Prop * (-1), Pop_Prop * 1),\n    Pop_Label = paste0(abs(round(Pop_Prop, digits = 3)), \"%\")\n  ) %>%\n  # plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = Pop_Prop, y = AG, label = Pop_Label)) + \n  # fill the value for the plot\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Sex), inherit.aes = TRUE) +\n  # display label for the bar\n  geom_text(aes(label = Pop_Label), \n            position = position_nudge(x = label_position_nudge(pop_summary)), \n            size = 5, \n            color=\"darkgrey\") + \n  # change color of male and female\n  scale_fill_manual(\"\", values = c(\"#EF756A\", \"#3FBFC5\")) + \n  # add x-ticks\n  scale_x_continuous(\"\", \n                     breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n=10),\n                     labels = function(br) tick_position_nudge(br))+\n  # add tick labels\n  labs(title = \"Singapore Population of Top 9 Planning Areas\",\n       subtitle = \"Population Pyramid by Gender & Age Groups, June 2022\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Age Groups\",\n       caption = dsl\n       ) + \n  # group by planning areas\n  facet_wrap(~ PA, ncol = 3) +\n  # apply theme\n  theme_bw() + \n  # adjust legend\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 16),\n        legend.position = 'top', \n        axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  )"
